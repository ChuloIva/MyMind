I've been feeling really overwhelmed at work lately. My boss keeps piling on more responsibilities and I feel like I can never meet his expectations. It's like nothing I do is ever good enough. I constantly worry that I'm going to get fired, even though my performance reviews have been fine.

At home, things aren't much better. My partner and I have been arguing more frequently, mostly about money and household responsibilities. I feel like I'm carrying all the weight and she doesn't appreciate what I do. Sometimes I think she'd be better off without me.

I've been having trouble sleeping because my mind just races with all these negative thoughts. I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong - what if I lose my job, what if my relationship fails, what if I can't pay the bills. It feels like I'm stuck in this cycle and I don't know how to break out of it.

I know I should probably exercise more and eat better, but I just don't have the energy. After work, I just want to collapse on the couch and watch TV. I used to enjoy hiking and being outdoors, but I haven't done that in months. I feel disconnected from my friends too - I keep making excuses not to hang out because I don't want to bring down the mood.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just not cut out for adult life. Everyone else seems to have it figured out, but I feel like I'm just pretending to be competent while everything falls apart around me.
